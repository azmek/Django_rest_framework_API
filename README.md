# Django_rest_framework_API
Django_rest_framework_API From scratch


Django rest framework doesn't need to be complicated, flesh out the stuff you don't need and you will understant it quickly, check it out.

A small application where a rest framework api is built from scratch with the minimum requirement from Django, so there is no app, 
the app is the project and files are added as needed.
based on django rest framework we create a drinks api and consuming it on the front end too via the consume.py file again with basic output on the console, 
most of the api testing is done via postman or restframework ui.

If you just want to play around with it, i have included the requirements txt
just create a virtual environment and install the requirements

Happy coding
